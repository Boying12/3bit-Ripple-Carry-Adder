# 3bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder
A full-custom 3-bit ripple carry adder designed at the transistor level. The project includes optimal transistor sizing, HSPICE simulation, layout implementation, and post-layout verification. Worst-case propagation delay and average power were analyzed and compared before and after parasitic extraction.
